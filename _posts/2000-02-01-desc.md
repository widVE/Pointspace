In computer graphics, we make trade-offs between interactivity and realism.  While we know how to make computer graphics that are realistic, they often take a long time to compute.  Alternatively, we know how to make things interactive, but can't approach the visual complexity of real-world environments.  However, what we want is the best of both worlds.

Real-world environments are particularly challenging because the clutter and chaos of real-world spaces does not map well to mathematical models.
